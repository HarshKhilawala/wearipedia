wearables in development

</div>


This library's structure is loosely inspired by that of Hugging Face's fantastic libraries (e.g. `transformers`, `diffusers`), and its documentation was adapted from SymPy's.

### Set up bots

- Set up [Dependabot](https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/enabling-and-disabling-version-updates#enabling-github-dependabot-version-updates) to ensure you have the latest dependencies.
- Set up [Stale bot](https://github.com/apps/stale) for automatic issue closing.

## üöÄ Features

### Development features

- Supports for `Python 3.9` and higher.
- [`Poetry`](https://python-poetry.org/) as the dependencies manager. See configuration in [`pyproject.toml`](https://github.com/rodrigo-castellon/wearipedia/blob/master/pyproject.toml) and [`setup.cfg`](https://github.com/rodrigo-castellon/wearipedia/blob/master/setup.cfg).
- Automatic codestyle with [`black`](https://github.com/psf/black), [`isort`](https://github.com/timothycrosley/isort) and [`pyupgrade`](https://github.com/asottile/pyupgrade).
- Ready-to-use [`pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com/) hooks with code-formatting.
- Type checks with [`mypy`](https://mypy.readthedocs.io); docstring checks with [`darglint`](https://github.com/terrencepreilly/darglint); security checks with [`safety`](https://github.com/pyupio/safety) and [`bandit`](https://github.com/PyCQA/bandit)
- Testing with [`pytest`](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/).
- Ready-to-use [`.editorconfig`](https://github.com/rodrigo-castellon/wearipedia/blob/master/.editorconfig), [`.dockerignore`](https://github.com/rodrigo-castellon/wearipedia/blob/master/.dockerignore), and [`.gitignore`](https://github.com/rodrigo-castellon/wearipedia/blob/master/.gitignore). You don't have to worry about those things.

### Deployment features

- `GitHub` integration: issue and pr templates.
- `Github Actions` with predefined [build workflow](https://github.com/rodrigo-castellon/wearipedia/blob/master/.github/workflows/build.yml) as the default CI/CD.
- Everything is already set up for security checks, codestyle checks, code formatting, testing, linting, docker builds, etc with [`Makefile`](https://github.com/rodrigo-castellon/wearipedia/blob/master/Makefile#L89). More details in [makefile-usage](#makefile-usage).
- [Dockerfile](https://github.com/rodrigo-castellon/wearipedia/blob/master/docker/Dockerfile) for your package.
- Always up-to-date dependencies with [`@dependabot`](https://dependabot.com/). You will only [enable it](https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/enabling-and-disabling-version-updates#enabling-github-dependabot-version-updates).
- Automatic drafts of new releases with [`Release Drafter`](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/release-drafter). You may see the list of labels in [`release-drafter.yml`](https://github.com/rodrigo-castellon/wearipedia/blob/master/.github/release-drafter.yml). Works perfectly with [Semantic Versions](https://semver.org/) specification.

### Open source community features

- Ready-to-use [Pull Requests templates](https://github.com/rodrigo-castellon/wearipedia/blob/master/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) and several [Issue templates](https://github.com/rodrigo-castellon/wearipedia/tree/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE).
- Files such as: `LICENSE`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, and `SECURITY.md` are generated automatically.
- [`Stale bot`](https://github.com/apps/stale) that closes abandoned issues after a period of inactivity. (You will only [need to setup free plan](https://github.com/marketplace/stale)). Configuration is [here](https://github.com/rodrigo-castellon/wearipedia/blob/master/.github/.stale.yml).
- [Semantic Versions](https://semver.org/) specification with [`Release Drafter`](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/release-drafter).

## Installation

## üìà Releases

You can see the list of available releases on the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/rodrigo-castellon/wearipedia/releases) page.

We follow [Semantic Versions](https://semver.org/) specification.

We use [`Release Drafter`](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/release-drafter). As pull requests are merged, a draft release is kept up-to-date listing the changes, ready to publish when you‚Äôre ready. With the categories option, you can categorize pull requests in release notes using labels.

### List of labels and corresponding titles

|               **Label**               |  **Title in Releases**  |
| :-----------------------------------: | :---------------------: |
|       `enhancement`, `feature`        |       üöÄ Features       |
| `bug`, `refactoring`, `bugfix`, `fix` | üîß Fixes & Refactoring  |
|       `build`, `ci`, `testing`        | üì¶ Build System & CI/CD |
|              `breaking`               |   üí• Breaking Changes   |
|            `documentation`            |    üìù Documentation     |
|            `dependencies`             | ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Dependencies updates |

You can update it in [`release-drafter.yml`](https://github.com/rodrigo-castellon/wearipedia/blob/master/.github/release-drafter.yml).

GitHub creates the `bug`, `enhancement`, and `documentation` labels for you. Dependabot creates the `dependencies` label. Create the remaining labels on the Issues tab of your GitHub repository, when you need them.
